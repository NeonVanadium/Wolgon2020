The more members in your party, the more likely you are to experience wild encounters.

TODO:
- Find a way to remove the exit buttons (or buttons in general) from the WorldPanel when the room changes
		(so they can be replaced)
- Overhaul Zones
	- Instead of Zone objects, each AWolgonPanel has one big "Zone Board"
	- A function call will create a new zone by providing a rectangle which will fill space on that Zone Board
		- Allow it to be done via a ratio as is now, as opposed to raw values
		- This may save on overhead, and will allow better control of zones (left bounds plz)
	- OPTIONAL, LOW PRIORITY: Allow Labels to appear to the left of their parent as opposed to just below.3
