The more members in your party, the more likely you are to experience wild encounters.

TODO:

	-	EventPanel
	- 	Optimize draw (label and or AWolgonPanel, I guess both) so that labels aren't being repositioned without 
		anything changing
	- 	Automatically adjust text sizes to stay somewhat consistent with window size
	-	Objects, even if they can only be looked at (eg the crier's platform in Gan Square)
